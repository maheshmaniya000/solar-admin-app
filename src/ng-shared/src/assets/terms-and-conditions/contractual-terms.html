    <p><strong>2. We both are in the legal relationship </strong></p>
    <p><em>General</em></p>
    <p>By ordering of any of the Paid Services by you as a Customer, you are entering into a legal agreement with us, consisting of these GCT notwithstanding any prior acceptance of GCT version valid at the time of earlier acceptance. GCT´ wording, valid at the moment of purchase, shall always be linked to the particular purchase of the Paid Services.</p>
    <p>
        <br> Each Customer must take into account that any activity of any person under the Customer Account is considered by Solargis to be the activity of the Customer. Therefore, the Customer, which pays for the services, must ensure that none of the appointed persons is in breach of Customer´s obligations and its interest.</p>
    <p>The use of the Paid Services is subject to the prior payment of particular price determined for each type of the Paid Services upon Solargis´ sole discretion (see Pricing on the Apps Page, where the actual prices at the moment of the purchase are displayed). Solargis reserves the right to change its prices at any time without any prior notice.</p>
    <p>All prices shall be deemed to be in EURO, except as specifically stated otherwise by Solargis. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by Solargis), all prices are exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”), and you shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of Paid Services, or to any payments or purchases made by you. If Solargis&nbsp;is obliged to collect or pay Taxes for the prices payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding fees and will be reflected in the invoice for such transaction.</p>
    <p><em>Acceptation of these GCT</em></p>
    <p>If you as the Customer decide to buy certain Paid Services, you will be invited to accept actual GCT within the process of purchase.</p>
    <p>When you as the Customer are ordering through the Customer Account any Paid Service (“<strong>Order</strong>”) you become bound by GCT, from the moment you select the interactive box “<strong>I accept</strong>”. This way you also accept that all our commercial communication is in English and the use of Slovak language is not required neither for these GCT nor for the contract itself.</p>
    <p><strong>If you do not fully understand and agree to GCT please immediately stop the Order of the respective Paid Services and contact us.</strong></p>
    <p>Before the final submission of the binding <strong>Order </strong>for Paid Services, the Customer is provided by the summary of its Order (“<strong>Order Summary</strong>”) and still has the chance to change it, cancel it and/or make necessary adjustment to the data in its Customer Account.</p>
    <p>The Order is confirmed by Solargis by returned e-mail, mentioning the control (Order) number and Order code. Confirmation of an Order by Solargis means that the contract is valid and effective and binding for both parties („<strong>Binding </strong><strong>Contract</strong>“).</p>
    <p>Delivery/activation of the Paid Services is however subject to prior payment of the price.</p>
    <p><em>Payments</em></p>
    <p>Within the ordering process the Customer decides whether the payment is made i) <strong>on line</strong> using the banking cards or other e-payment instrument or ii) <strong>through the bank transfer</strong>. In the latter the Customer is provided first with „pro forma invoice“ by e-mail specifying the terms of payment.</p>
    <p>Under the on-line payment scheme pursuant to the point i) in the above paragraph, the payment is considered as accomplished when the system shows that it was already processed.</p>
    <p>In case of bank transfer under the point ii), the payment is considered as accomplished when the respective amount arrives to a designated bank account of Solargis.</p>
    <p><em>Invoicing</em></p>
    <p>After the payments are accomplished, the Solargis shall issue and deliver to the Customer electronically by e-mail (unless instructed otherwise by the Customer) the final invoice within the period of three business days.</p>
    <p>The physical person making the Order must be aware of the fact, that Solargis shall issue the invoice on the name of the Customer (assigned to respective Customer Account) who will be liable for the proper taxation and accountancy handling.</p>
    <p><em>Termination of the Binding Contract for non- payment </em></p>
    <p>Should the Customer´s payment is not accomplished within 60 days upon the Binding Contract completion, Solargis has the right to unilaterally cancel the Binding Contract even without notifying the Customer.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Solargis also reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Customer Account and/or right to access and use of Paid Services if the Customer has violated GCT.</p>

    <p><em>Permitted type and scope of use</em></p>
    <p>The Customer may exploit the Paid Services only for one of below listed purposes, depending on the option he has selected during the ordering process:</p>
    <p><strong>a) <u>Project Use</u></strong> means exploiting the Applications and Outputs by Customer aiming at providing the services for its clients and customers being the end users of such Customers (“<strong>End Users</strong>”). End Users cannot get the original Data Sets, the Customer is only allowed to deliver the results of analysis supported by already processed data by the Customer accompanied by the relevant reports, charts, schedules etc or Data Reports provided the content is unchanged and the source “<strong>Solar resource data © [Year] Solargis</strong>” is referenced.</p>
    <p><strong>b) <u>Academic Use</u></strong> means exploiting the Applications and Outputs only by academic environment (university, research institution) for teaching, running seminars or symposiums, writing and publishing, all this on non-commercial basis except getting possible copyright royalties in case of publishing. Publishing of the Data Reports or making Data Reports available to the public, without designation of its origin is strictly prohibited. Likewise, it is strictly prohibited to publish or make available to any third party the Data Sets, which must be kept confidential. Pricing of Academic Use, comparing to Project Use is always subject of discount.</p>
    <p>Depending on the chosen Application within the Project Use, the Customer shall be allowed through its Active Users to download and work with Data Sets either as being only the Customer´s contractual employees, statutory bodies and nominated representatives (i.e. by “<strong>Internal Staff</strong>”) or also as collaborating persons (especially consultants, investors, architects, engineers, constructors) on provable contractual basis and working on the same project (“<strong>Project Staff</strong>”). Academic use is restricted to Internal staff only.</p>
    <p>Within the process of ordering the Paid Services the Customer shall be acquainted with all the relevant information concerning the accepted Active Users representing the Internal or Project Staff. Number of allowed Active Users within the ordered Paid Services shall be subject of specific pricing policy using the commercial tools like single and multiple use at the sole discretion of Solargis.</p>
    <p>Any person can be nominated as a Passive Users whereas they are allowed just read and share the Data Reports. They are not allowed to get access to Data Sets. Their number of Passive Users within each of the ordered Paid services is unlimited.</p>
    <p>Any other use and any other user than those stated above is strictly prohibited.</p>
    <p>The Customer shall be liable for nomination of its Active Users compliant with these GCT and the Apps Page navigation within the process of ordering the Paid Services whereas Solargis recommends providing such authorisations only to the extent necessary and avoid possible misuse of Data Sets by any third party pursuing its own separate goals.</p>
    <p>In each case when the Customer provides Outputs to a third party, it remains solely liable towards Solargis for the unproper, unauthorised use by such third party. We therefore highly recommend to the Customer, giving the Outputs to any third parties, to make them, by reverse, contractually liable towards the Customer in case of their misconduct.</p>
    <p><u>Customer is not allowed, under any circumstances, to invite as Active and/or Passive Users the participants of a tender or any third party who gathers the same data for its own purposes, projects, for independent data processing and any other specific business use (“<strong>Other Use</strong>”). </u><u>Provision of Outputs for Other Use by the Customers is not allowed without the consent of Solargis. </u></p>
    <p>In case you are interested in using Solargis data for Other Use, please contact us directly by e-mail contact@solargis.com.</p>
    <p><em>Particular Conditions</em></p>
    <p>Particular Conditions comprise the summary of the fundamental terms and conditions and/or any further rules, limitations or exceptions in limitations to use Outputs in extent of Terms of Use and GCT shown within the process of Order before selection of the interactive box I accept and also at each occasion of download of the Data Sets following the Customer´s Online Activity during the Subscription Period (“<strong>Particular Conditions</strong>”). The Customer will see the Particular Conditions also in Order Summary and in the Outputs provided (e.g. in the Data Report).</p>
    <p>Particular conditions, in extent which differs from the terms and limitations as stated in Terms of Use and GCT (together as the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are always prevailing the Terms and would apply on the respective Outputs with respect to the terms and scope of your entitlement to dispose with and/or utilize each of provided Outputs.</p>

However Solargis may grant to the Customer upon request a non-exclusive right to utilize such Output, to create any of its derivative works („<strong>Derivative Works</strong>“).</p>

    <p><em>Breach of terms and conditions of Outputs´ use and IP Rights</em></p>
    <p>Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Solargis, its officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages or injuries of any kind and nature arising out of any cause or event which is attributable to its use of the Outputs (especially Data Sets) in breach of these GCT.</p>

    <p>The Terms do not convey any right or interest in or to Intellectual Property of Solargis (or any part thereof), except only for the limited license expressly granted by Solargis. Nothing in these Terms constitute an assignment or waiver of Solargis´ IP rights under any law.</p>
