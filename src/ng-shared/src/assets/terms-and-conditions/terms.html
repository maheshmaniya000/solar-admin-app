  <li>Business Entity can create a Customer account (“<strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Account</strong>”) which will enable the Customer to make orders for Paid Services and other specific operation as the case may be. The Customer Account is always created by a physical person having authorisation to act in the name of the Customer (“<strong>Authorized Person</strong>”) and such individual becomes the first administrator of the Customer and gets its entry credentials.</li>
</ul><p>Whenever these entire Terms of Use apply to both the Registered User and the Customer, the general term “<strong>Recipient</strong>” is used herein.</p><p><strong><u>Entitlements </u></strong></p><p>The Registration will entitle the Registered User just to get ad hoc Free Trial.</p><p>Only the Customer through the first administrator or through other administrators, i.e. persons obtaining the entitlement from the first administrator (hereinafter any and all these persons to as “<strong>Administrators</strong>” or individually as “<strong>Administrator</strong>”) can order the Paid Services. Each of Administrators has or gets its own credentials.</p><h2>Legal responsibility of the Recipients</h2><p>By using any of the Free Services by Registered User, this Registered User is not considered to be our contractual partner. Registered User must respect the Fundamental Rules when using the Free Services and such user becomes liable for breach of these Terms of Use when using the Free Services contrary to these Terms of Use.</p><p>Customer enters into contractual relationship with Solargis consisting of these Terms of Use and General Contractual Terms and will be responsible for any breach of such terms, notwithstanding which specific Administrator or the person, who derived its acting under the Customer from Administrator, was actually in failure. This would apply also in case any person will act in the name of the Customer by misusing the login credentials which must be kept confidential. However, in case it is proven that the Administrator was false or fictive, the Business Entity being declared as Customer would not be held liable. In such case the false or fictive Administrator shall be solely liable as a physical person.</p><p>Solargis strictly assumes that the Customer and the payer are identical persons and the Administrator is entitled to act in the name and on the account of the Customer. The invoices, sent only by e-mail to the Administrator ordering the Paid Services, are issued on the name of the Customers and the Administrator/s of the Customer would be responsible for due delivery/submission for proper accounting of all invoices provided by Solargis to such Administrators to the Customer.</p><h2>Account Creation</h2><p><em><u>Entries</u></em></p><p>Each time the Business Entity wishes to establish a Customer Account, the Authorised Person must fill-in the requested form. The obligatory items include business name, seat, VAT number, name and e-mail of the Authorized Person and another contact person, as the case may be. Creation of the Customer Account is confirmed by allocation of unique identification number for each new Customer by Solargis (“<strong>IDN</strong>”).</p><p>In principle the Customer Account is to be created whenever the Customer is interested in ordering the Paid Services.</p><p>Each Customer shall have only one Customer Account. A person attempting to create a duplicate Customer Account will be always notified by Solargis, and the conflict will be resolved.</p><p><em><u>Administrators of Customer Account </u></em></p><p>The first Administrator (i.e. the Authorized Person that created for the first time the Customer Account) will get specific and privileged position, which means this person will be initially only allowed to make any and all defined operations offered to the Customer on the Apps Page. Therefore, be always careful when creating the Customer Account.</p><p>The first Administrator can also delegate its authorisation to act as the Administrator of the Customer to another Administrator either individually or along with him using the invitation. Administrators shall always get technical means to organise the orders and operations of the Customer either by themselves or through new invited persons (Active and Passive users as defined below) under the same IDN.</p><p>Exceptionally it might happen that a third party claims that the Administrator has not been entitled to act in the name of the Customer and is asking either for the replacement of the Administrator or for the new Customer Account creation after termination of the previous. Solargis, in this situation shall reserve the right to make its own investigation (e.g. with respect of clear identification of a person entitled to act in the name of the Customer), contact the statutory body or other entitled persons of the Customer or negotiate in good faith with the persons concerned in order to solve the dispute. Following its findings, it will belong to the sole discretion of the Solargis to decide on the Customer Account destiny.</p><p>Only the Administrator/s are allowed to set a permission to any other person to be recognised (by its name and e-mail address), including already Registered Users, to make one or more operations with purchased Deliverables (except making purchases of Paid Services, which is allowed only to Administrators) under the same IDN of the Customer (see below point iii)).</p><p><em><u>Authorisations of the Administrator/s</u></em></p><p>In particular the Administrator is allowed</p><ol><li>To make changes to the entry data in the Customer Account (change its e-mail, make respective update of the name, address and VAT identification number of the Customer (e.g. in case of merger, division),</li>
  <li>To make orders in the name and on the account of Customer,</li>
  <li>Invite any individuals
  <ol><li>to work and actively exploit the purchased Paid Services (“<strong>Active Users</strong>”), i.e. download and work with the already ordered solar and meteorological data sets in xls or csv format (hereinafter as “<strong>Data Sets</strong>”) and related pdf report (“<strong>Data Report</strong>”) (together Data Sets and Data Report as “<strong>Outputs</strong>”),</li>
    <li>to use Application/s in a read-only mode and to use and share the Data Reports (“<strong>Passive Users</strong>”), while Passive users are not allowed to download or use the Data Sets,</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>To delegate its powers to other Administrators.</li>
</ol><p>Any of above mentioned operations and/or acts of Administrators, Active Users or Passive Users might be subject of certain payment to be made by Customer, which would be always displayed on the respective web page of Solargis whenever applicable. Without the respective payment such operation shall then not be allowed.</p><p>It is strictly forbidden to appoint an Administrator who is not authorized to act on behalf of the Customer. Purchase of Paid Services and/or any paid extensions can be made only by Administrator. Each of the Administrators must have entitlement to act in the name and into account of the Customer and would be liable, if Solargis would get paid, that such payment has been executed and duly accounted and taxed, whenever applicable, by the Customer.</p><p><em>Users of the Customer Account</em></p><p>In order to benefit from the Customer Account, any invited Administrator, Active or Passive Users must accept the invitation in specific form, including to fill in the name and e-mail of such person, and so becoming the Registered User. After such acceptance the invited person will be linked to the IDN of the Customer based on its own entry credentials.</p><p>The number of Active Users and/or Passive Users (hereinafter together as “<strong>Customer Account Users</strong> may be subject of specific payment depending on the chosen type of services.</p><p>The Administrator is only allowed to invite such Active Users who i) are contractually employed by the Customer or are the statutory bodies of the Customer or acting on behalf of the Customer based on the power of attorney (“<strong>Internal Staff</strong>”) or ii) which closely participate on the same projects/task with the Customer (planned construction of the energy power plant, co-authors of the same study, consultants, other partners) and therefore are closely contractually or otherwise connected with a Customer with respect of the relevant project (“<strong>Project Staff</strong>”). In certain Paid Services it may be required that the Active Users represent the Internal Staff only and no third parties are allowed become the Active User.</p><p>Anybody having the Registration can be invited As Passive User.</p><p><u>Customer is not allowed, under any circumstances, to invite as Active and/or Passive Users the participants of a tender or any third party who gathers the same data for its own purposes, own projects, for independent data processing and any other specific business use (“<strong>External Staff</strong>”).</u></p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>External Staff within Active Users shall only be accepted in special circumstances, ad hoc and obtaining specific approval from Solargis. In such occasions please contact us by e-mail contact@solargis.com.</p><h2>Further Subscription Rules</h2><p>If anyone other than Administrator/s or authorized Customer Account Users access any of the Websites Content through the Customer Account, such person may perform any actions available to the Customer and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred in the name of the Customer. Therefore, we strongly encourage the Administrators and Customer Account Users to keep the log-in credentials allowing to be assigned to the Customer Account confidential as we consider such Customer as solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under the Customer Account of the Customer.</p><p>Solargis assumes that the Administrator/s and Customer Account Users provided and would always provide Solargis with accurate and complete information when creating the Customer Account or accepting the invitations.</p><p>We ask any individual working under the Customer Account to inform us immediately in the future if he has any reason to believe that his log-in credentials have become known to anyone else, or if the created Registration or Customer Account (including invitation of Active and Passive Users) is being, or is likely to be, used in an unauthorized manner. This includes also the invitation of Active Users in excess of Internal and/or Project Staff.</p><p>If any individual has used unclear or misleading data when making Registration and/or creating the Customer Account we reserve the right to make proper corrections, based on our reasonable judgment.</p><p>We ask the Customers to carefully review these further Subscription Rules and consider adapting the Customer´s practices accordingly, to ensure that what we believe to be “the Customer´s entitlement” under the Customer Account remains as such:</p><ol><li>Any legal act initiated by any Administrator within the Customer Account is to be made in the name and on to account of the Customer having the same IDN;</li>
  <li>If any Paid Services were provided in relation to the Customer Account, the Customer only shall be considered as the contractual party of Solargis and any payment made to Solargis will be considered as made by the Customer just as it it is mentioned in the invoice.</li>
  <li>If Customer is claiming the payments were not made by the Customer or were made mistakenly by the Customer, the Administrator ordering the paid services under the Customer Account shall be hold liable for any harm, damage or inconveniences caused to the Solargis.</li>
</ol><h2>Modification and Cancellation by Solargis</h2><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Solargis may change, suspend or terminate any of Deliverables (or any features thereof, or prices applicable thereto) at any time and in any manner provided Customer or any person creating the Customer Account, or invited Active or Passive Users act in the contrary to these Terms of Use and also in case the invited person accepts its position contrary to these Terms of Use.
