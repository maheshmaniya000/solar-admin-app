  <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>The privacy of our clients is important to us. We are committed to protect and safeguard any personal data you give us. The text below describes how we use and process your personal data and what are your rights and possibilities with respect to such processing. You will also find here information how you can contact us if you have any questions about your personal data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Personal data</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>We receive and store information that you voluntarily provide when using our solargis.com and solargis.info websites (“Websites”) and services. Despite the fact that our services can be purchased exclusively by entrepreneurs, professionals, governmental institutions, agencies and other institutions, whose data should not be considered as personal data, it may happen that when you establish customer account or registration at our Websites, you may provide us also with some of your personal information including your name, email address, telephone number or other basic contact information. You may also happen to provide additional personal information to us when you voluntarily communicate with us, such as when you request information through our contact form or register for newsletter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Purpose of processing and legal basis</em></strong></p><p>Primarily, we use the personal data that we receive from you to provide information and perform services that you request. The legal basis for such processing is the performance of a contract and/or the adoption of steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract (pre-contractual relations).</p><p>In addition, we have a legitimate interest in using your information to improve our Websites and offered services and also for our administrative and internal business purposes.</p><p>We process your personal data for marketing purposes only with your explicit consent, i.e. if you sign up for our newsletter. You can revoke such consent at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@solargis.com"><strong>contact</strong></a><strong><a href="mailto:contact@solargis.com">@solargis.com</a>&nbsp;</strong>or by clicking on the “Unsubscribe button” offered directly in each newsletter. In case of revocation of the consent, we will immediately stop processing the respective personal data and delete them, unless there is another legal basis for their further processing. However, any processing performed before the revocation of your consent will remain lawful. <span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Cookies </em></strong></p><p class="fab6k8g"><span>We use common website management technologies called cookies and similar technologies, which have different functions.</span></p><p class="fab6k8g"><span>A cookie is a small data file, which often includes a unique but non-identifying code that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow you to be recognized as the same user across the pages of a website. Cookies also allow your choices to be remembered – choices such as the language you prefer, the currency you use and your search criteria. They will also make sure you are recognized when you return to our Websites.</span></p><p class="fab6k8g"><span>Other technologies we use on the Websites are tracking technologies used for tracking of visitors’ behavior on the Websites and session storage or local storage technologies used for internal purposes of our online applications. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our Websites.</span></p><p class="fab6k8g"><span>We work with third-party companies, who are authorized to place third-party cookies or similar technologies for storing information on our Websites with our permission. These third-party companies may use these technologies to help us compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We do not permit any of these third-party companies to collect any of your personal information for their own purposes. These third-party companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions on their use or collection of any personal information.</span></p><p class="fab6k8g"><span>You can manage use of cookies through your browser settings. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. This action, however, might affect correct functioning of some features on the Websites. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Retention of your personal data</em></strong></p><p>In broad terms, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of the data and the reason that we have the data in the first place. We have procedures in place regarding our retention periods which we keep under review taking into account our reasons for processing of your personal data and the legal basis for doing so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Share and transfer of personal data</em></strong></p><p>We will never sell any of your personal data to a third party. However, in order for us to provide our services to you, we share your personal data with our trusted third party service providers, e.g. authorised payment providers such as First Data Slovakia, s. r. o. and PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.Whenever we share your personal data, we put safeguards in place which require these organisations to keep your data safe and to ensure that they do not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.</p><p>We may need to transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) for example the USA, if we work with a supplier which processes some of its personal data outside of the EEA. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the EEA, so your personal data may not be subject to the same protections. However, in such cases, we will make sure that any transfer of your personal data to the countries outside the EEA is subject to appropriate safeguards as if it were being processed inside the EEA and under the guiding principles set out in this Privacy Policy. If you would like further information please contact us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Security of your personal data</em></strong></p><p>We take the security of your personal data very seriously.&nbsp;We use appropriate procedures to protect and safeguard the personal data you give us. We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and development of technologies, however, we cannot assure that the information you provide us will remain free from any loss, misuse or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Your rights</em></strong></p><p>In connection with the processing of your data you have the rights of a data subject, namely:</p><ul><li>the right of access to your personal data (providing a copy of your personal data) and the right to information on the terms of processing of personal data;</li>
  <li>the right to request rectification and completion of your inaccurate or incomplete personal data;</li>

  <li>the right to transfer the personal data to you or another service provider in a simple, structured format.</li>
</ul><p>To exercise the rights described above, please send an email to <strong>contact@solargis.com</strong>.</p><p>In addition, you have the right to file a complaint with the Personal Data Protection Office of the Slovak Republic, if you consider that the processing of your personal data is contrary to the GDPR.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><em>Changes to this Privacy Policy</em></strong></p><p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes we will let you know but please regularly check this policy to ensure you are aware of the most updated version.</p><p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on&nbsp;<strong>26th July 2018</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Contact details of the controller</em></strong></p><p>If you have any questions about your personal data you can contact us by sending an email at the address <strong><a href="mailto:contact@solargis.com">contact@solargis.com</a>&nbsp;</strong>or by sending a letter to the address:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Solargis s.r.o.</p><p>Bottova 2A</p><p>811 09 Bratislava</p><p>Slovakia</p>
