    <p>6. Customer neither can share Outputs with its End Users nor with any independent third parties except possible sharing of Data Reports provided the content is unchanged and the source “Solar resource data © [Year] Solargis” is referenced.

No part of this restriction shall disallow the creation of studies, reports or analyses produced as a paid or unpaid service of the Customer for a third party based on Data Sets or Data Reports as long as the Data Sets are not transferred to the End Users. There are no restrictions on use of Data Report, provided the source “Solar resource data © [Year] Solargis” is referenced.
        <br>
        <br>8. Customer hereby obtains only the right to use the Data Sets (e.g. to read, analyse, include them either inchanged or already adjusted in summaries, studies, chart, map, diagram, alternative solutions) in accordance with the Terms and these Particular Conditions and that no other right, title or interest in or to any copyrights, trademarks, or other proprietary rights relating to Data Sets is transferred from Solargis to the Customer.</p>
