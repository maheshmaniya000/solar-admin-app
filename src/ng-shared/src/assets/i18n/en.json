The synthetic generation of typical year dataset is a mathematical process that results in loss of the coherence between solar irradiance and air temperature. Also, the frequency distribution of the hourly values in the resulting artificial time series may not represent real conditions of the climate. As the performance of solar power systems varies with solar irradiance and air temperature, use of synthetic hourly dataset increases the uncertainty of solar energy simulations.
